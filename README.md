<center>**Seasons VR**<br></br>

In this project I explored the world of virtual reality and how I can create my own environments through the use of three.js
The theme of my project was 'Seasons', in which I created 4 environments, each one representing a different season.
Throughout this project I also further developed my 3D modelling skills, as all the models used in my project were created through Blender.

I felt that this was an interesting project to create as I've always been curious about VR and how it works, so I was excited to explore it more in depth. The goal was to create environments that were fun to look around with lots going on, but also create a unique experience each time through randomization so each experience was a little bit different. I feel as though I achieved this goal to an extent, as in a lot of environments there are many random factors such as tree placement and other background assets appearing in random locations on each load. This is one aspect I would love to add onto in the future, implementing more randomization through what animals appear in a scene and other key features to make the user's experience even more unique each time.

**Notes**  
<br></br>

All code commenting for the js files is on spring.js, unless there is a unique piece of code specific to a js file.  
Please allow time for all objects to load, this will not take long.  
Scenes can also be explored on computers by using mouse controls.  
To switch scenes you must remove your phone and go back a page and select your new scene.
